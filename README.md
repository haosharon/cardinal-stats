Cardinal Stats
==============================


Most collegiate volleyball teams track statistics based on a number rating system. It can be tough to track multiple statistics at once in a fast-paced game. This app aims to solve those problems by taking advantage of the iPad's large screen by using a space-saving __grid based system__, and by requiring user inputs through __sequences of inputs__ instead of choosing an one of many input options.

Setting up for development
--------------------------

```bash
$ cd cardinal-stats
$ meteor
```

**cardinal-stats** will be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
